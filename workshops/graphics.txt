<h1>Displaying data using graphs and tables</h1>
The purpose of this exercise is to tour the table and graphics capabilities of R, and to explore the best methods for displaying patterns in data. If you need help with some of the commands, check the "Graphs/Tables" tab at the <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/R/">R tips</a> page.
<h2><a name="mammal"></a>Data set 1: Body mass   of late   Quaternary mammals</h2>
These data were published as a data paper in Ecology and deposited in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ecological   Archives</span> (F. A. Smith, S. K. Lyons, S. K. M. Ernest, K. E. Jones, D. M. Kaufman, T. Dayan, P. A. Marquet, J. H. Brown, and J. P. Haskell. 2003. Body mass of late Quaternary mammals. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ecology</span> 84: 3403.) See the <a href="http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/094/">metadata</a> for a description.

Most of the variables are categorical, with multiple named categories. "Continent" includes mammals on islands ("Insular" category) whereas "Oceanic" refers to marine mammals. Body mass is the sole numeric variable. The "status" variable indicates whether species is currently present in the wild (extant), extinct as of late Pleistocene (extinct), extinct within the last 300 years (historical), or an introduced species (introduction).
<h3>Read and examine the data</h3>
The original data were saved in mammals.csv file on our server <a href="../../../data/mammals.csv">here</a>. Download the file to your computer and open in a spreadsheet program (e.g., Excel, Calc) to have a look at it.

Start R and read the contents of the file to a data frame. You will need to modify the default argument that identifies missing data to <code>na.strings=""</code> (or <code>na=""</code> if you are using <code>read_csv</code> from the <code>readr</code> package) because in this data file "NA" is used to symbolize North America in the continent column rather than missing data (don't do this in your own data).

Use the <code>head</code> function to view the first few lines of the data frame on the screen. You'll see that every row represents the data for a different mammal species.
<h3>Frequency tables</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Which continent has the greatest number of mammal species? Which has the least? Make a table of the frequency of cases on each continent (remember that the category "NA" in continent stands for North America, not missing data).</li>
 	<li>You'll notice in the frequency table for the variable "continent" that there's a typo in the data. One case is shown as having the continent "Af" rather than "AF". Fix this using the command line in R and recalculate the frequency table.</li>
 	<li>How many extinct mammals are recorded in the data file? Use a frequency table to find out.</li>
 	<li>Create a two-way frequency table (contingency table) showing the status of mammal species on each continent. Which continent has the greatest number of extinctions relative to the number of extant species?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Visualize frequency distributions</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Plot the number of mammal species on each continent using a simple bar graph. Include a label for the y axis.</li>
 	<li>The plot categories are listed in alphabetical order by default, which is arbitrary and makes the visual display less efficient than other possibilities. Redo the bar graph with the continents appearing in order of decreasing numbers of species.</li>
 	<li>Generate a histogram of the body masses of mammal species. How informative is that?!</li>
 	<li>Create a new variable in the mammal data frame: the log (base 10) of body mass. (See "Transform and add a variable" on the R tips "Data" page if you need help with this.)</li>
 	<li>Generate a histogram of log body mass. Is this more informative? Morphological data commonly require a log-transformation to analyze.</li>
 	<li>Redo the previous histogram but use a bin width of 2 units. How much detail is lost?</li>
 	<li>Redo the histogram but try a bin width of of 1; then try 0.5; and then 0.1. Which bin width is superior?</li>
 	<li>Redo the histogram, but display probability density instead of frequency.</li>
 	<li>How does the frequency distribution of log body mass depart from a normal distribution? Answer by visual examination of the histogram you just created. Now answer by examining a normal quantile plot instead. Which display is more informative?</li>
 	<li>Optional: redraw the histogram of log body mass and superimpose a normal density curve to assess help detect deviations from normality.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Visualize associations between variables</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Use a box plot to compare the distribution of body sizes (log scale most revealing) of mammals having different extinction status. Are extinct mammals similar to, larger than, or smaller than, extant mammals?</li>
 	<li>Examine the previous box plot. How do the shapes of the body size distributions compare between extinct and extant mammals?</li>
 	<li>Redo the previous box plot but make box width proportional to the square root of sample size. Add a title to the plot.</li>
 	<li>Optional: Draw a violin plot to compare the frequency distribution of log body sizes of mammals having different extinction status. Which do you find is more revealing about the shapes of the body size distributions: box plot or violin plot?</li>
 	<li>Use multiple histograms to compare the frequency distribution of log body sizes of mammals having different extinction status. Stack the panels one above the other. In this plot, how easy is it to visualize differences among treatments in the distributions compared to your previous plots?</li>
 	<li>Make a table of the median log body mass of each extinction-status group of mammals. Are the values consistent with the plotted distributions?</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="fly"></a>Data set 2: Fly sex and longevity</h2>
The data are from L. Partridge and M. Farquhar (1981), Sexual activity and the lifespan of male fruitflies, <it>Nature</it> 294: 580-581. The experiment placed male fruit flies with varying numbers of previously-mated or virgin females to investigate how mating activity affects male lifespan. The data are in the file fruitflies.csv file on our server <a href="../../../data/fruitflies.csv">here</a>.

Download the file to your computer and open in a spreadsheet program to have a look at it. Read the data file into a new data frame. Our goal here is to find a plot type that clearly and efficiently visualizes the patterns in the data, especially the differences among treatment groups.
<ol>
 	<li>View the first few lines of the data frame on the screen, and familiarize yourself with the variable names.</li>
 	<li>Use a strip chart to examine the distribution of longevities in the treatment groups. Try the jitter method to reduce overlap between points. If needed, adjust the size or rotation of the treatment labels so that they all fit on the graph. What pattern of differences between treatments in longevity is revealed?</li>
 	<li>Compare the strip chart to a box plot of the same data. Is the pattern in the data as clear in both types of plot?</li>
 	<li>The variable <code>thorax</code> stands for thorax length, which was used as a measure of body size. The measurement was included in case body size also affected longevity. Produce a scatter plot of thorax length and longevity. Make <code>longevity</code> the response variable (i.e., plot it on the vertical axis). Is there a relationship?</li>
 	<li>Redraw the scatter plot but this time use different symbols or colors for the different treatment groups. Add a legend to identify the symbols. Describe the pattern of differences between treatments.</li>
 	<li>Add scatterplot smoothers or linear regressions, to the previous figure, one for each group. Do the differences in longevity among the treatments stand out when variation in body size is incorporated?</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="plot"></a>EXTRA Making a plot from the ground up</h2>
Oe of the great advantages of R is the control level of control you have over making your graphs. You want it, you can (almost always) get it. The challenge is to figure out how. In this exercise you will make a scatter plot, strip it, and build it up just like you want it. Use ?par to check very useful graphic parameters.
<ol>
 	<li>Create a response and explanatory variable of equal length. Plot the variables in a scatter plot using plot().</li>
 	<li>Change the orientation of the y tick-mark labels and fill the circles red.</li>
<h3>Changing the axis.</h3>
 	<li>R determines the length of the axis, changes this to give it a little more space.</li>
 	<li>Let's change the tick mark distance on the y-axis. Use <code>yaxt = "n"</code> within plot to suppress the y-axis. Outside the <code>plot()</code> call you can now add new commands, like axis(). Use ?axis for more info. Add three locations (at = c(.., .., ..))for a label and name them (labels = c(.., .., ..)). Check the other features as well.</li>
Once a plot function is called, you can keep adding things to the plotting area (as long as it is within the plotting range as you can determine by xlim and ylim for new data).
 	<li>Let's add more data! Make another response variable (range has to be the same or less than your first variable: use range() to check this). Plot this using points() and make them green and a bigger size.</li>
 	<li>As a final touch add a letter or some text to the plot. Check out text().</li>
<h3>An empty plotting area</h3>
 	<li>Sometimes it can be useful to start completely from scratch and build up your graph from a blank document. Check out the following code plot(NA,  ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim, xlab = "", ylab = "", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n") and play around to see what each command does. Start by plotting some data using points(). Make sure you have two vectors called xlim and ylim containing the min and max value of either axis.</li>
