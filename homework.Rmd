## Assignment 3: Determine best model
This assignment is due Friday, November 30.

Clues to the inheritance patterns of population differences can be gained by fitting linear models to measurements of traits in parents and hybrids. In this assignment you will use model selection methods to compare the fit of three alternative genetic models of divergence in soil arsenic tolerance in two populations of the grass <i>Agrostis capillaris</i> (Watkins and MacNair 1991, Genetics of arsenic tolerance in <i>Agrostis capillaris</i>. Heredity 66: 47-54). One population occurred on an abandoned, arsenic-contaminated mine; the other was from an edaphically similar, non-toxic site.

To accomplish this you will need to choose a criterion (AIC or BIC) to decide the fit of models to the data, and to determine which is best suited to your purposes. You need to defend your choice of method vigorously in your report, which will require some research. Why did you decide to use it instead of the other criterion? Decide on the criterion *before* you analyze the data.

Height of plant tillers of different cross generations can be downloaded <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bio501/data/arsenic.csv">here</a>.

Height is the cube root of tiller height (in mm) when grown on arsenic-laced soil. Line refers to the parent population from the contaminated site ("high" tolerance), the parent population from the uncontaminated site ("low" tolerance), their F1 and F2 hybrids ("f1", "f2"), and the backcrosses between the F1 hybrid and each parent population ("bh" for high and "bl" for low tolerance). I'll refer to these crosses as genotypes.

Analyze these data in R according to the following methods. Note that this is not a complete list of expectations. Fit linear models with fixed effects only. Assume that all the data for a given cross type are independent. Provide all necessary explanations in your report. No <i>P</i>-values are allowed in your report. Include your R commands in an appendix.
<ol>
<li>Graph the data. Explain your graph. What is the pattern in the data?</li>
<li>Create a table of means and standard deviations of genotypes. Design the table as you would if you were publishing it.</li>
<li>Add a numeric variable in the data set to represent the proportion of the genome inherited from the high-tolerance parent:
&nbsp; 1 for the high-tolerance parent genotype
&nbsp; 0 for the low-tolerance parent genotype
&nbsp; 0.5 for the F1 and F2 hybrids
&nbsp; 0.25 for the backcross to the low tolerance population
&nbsp; 0.75 for the backcross to the high tolerance population
Make sure that the variable is numeric rather than a factor or character.</li>
<li>Fit the numeric variable you created in (3) to the height data using a linear model. This is called the additive model, whereby tolerance increases linearly with the proportion of the genome inherited from the high tolerance parent. Evaluate the model fit (Remember: no <i>P</i> values!).</li>
<li>Add another numeric variable to the data set to represent dominance effects that might be present in the hybrids:
&nbsp; 0 for both parent genotypes
&nbsp; 1 for the F1 hybrid
&nbsp; 0.5 for the remaining three hybrid genotypes
Make sure that the variable is numeric rather than a factor or character.</li>
<li>Fit a second model to the same data that includes both of the numeric variables created in (3) and (5). Leave out any interaction terms. This is the additive plus dominance model. Any dominance effects present will displace the mean value of the hybrids toward one or other of the parents relative to the values predicted by the additive model. Evaluate model fit.</li>
<li>Finally, fit a third model that has the original genotype variable as the only explanatory variable. The fit of this model will deviate from the model fitted in (6) if there is interaction (epistasis) between genes inherited from the two parents.</li>
<li>Present your results, comparing model fits. Which genetic model best fit the data? Explain and summarize.</li>
<li>Explain how the procedure you used above to analyze these data differs from that of conventional null hypothesis significance testing. In your view, would a null hypothesis significance testing approach be a poorer, equivalent, or superior approach to the one used above to decide between the three models? Explain.</li>
<li>Include your clean R code in an appendix.</li>
<li>Email paper to me as a single pdf file: LASTNAME.FIRSTNAME.ASSIGNMENT3.PDF</li>

## Assignment 3: Best genetic model
This assignment is due Friday, November 29.

Clues to the genetic basis of species differences can be gained by fitting linear models to measurements of traits in parents and hybrids. In this assignment you will use model selection methods to fit alternative genetic models to oviposition preference data in two host races of the planthopper <i>Nilaparvate nugens</i> (Sezer and Butlin 1998, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B 265: 2399-2405). One race occurs on cultivated rice. The other lives on the aquatic plant <i>Leersia</i>, which is probably the ancestral host.

To accomplish this you will need to choose a criterion (AIC or BIC) to decide the fit of models to the data, and to determine which is best, and so on. You need to defend your choice of method vigorously in your report, which will require some independent research. Why did you decide to use it instead of the other criterion? Decide on the criterion *before* you analyze the data.

Host oviposition preference data of females can be downloaded <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bio501/R/data/hopper.csv">HERE</a>.

Preference is the log-transformed ratio of the number of eggs laid on rice to the number laid on <i>Leersia</i>, when both plants were provided by the experimenters. Genotype refers to the parent race on rice ("rice"), the parent race on <i>Leersia</i> ("leer"), their F1 and F2 hybrids ("f1", "f2"), and the backcrosses between the F1 hybrid and each parent race ("br" for rice and "bl" for <i>Leersia</i>).

Analyze these data in R according to the following methods. Note that this is not a complete list of expectations. Fit linear models with fixed effects only. Assume that all the data for a given cross type are independent. Provide all necessary explanations in your report. No <i>P</i>-values are allowed in your report. Include your R commands in an appendix.

1. Visualize the oviposition preference of the different genotypes. What is the pattern in the data? Explain.
2. Create a table of means and standard deviations of the genotypes. Make this a high quality table rather than simply computer output. Don't worry about font.
3. Add a numeric variable in the data set to represent the proportion of the genome inherited from the rice parent:
<br>&nbsp; 1 for the rice parent genotype
<br>&nbsp; 0 for the <i>Leersia</i> parent genotype
<br>&nbsp; 0.5 for the F1 and F2 hybrids
<br>&nbsp; 0.25 for the backcross to the <i>Leersia</i> population
<br>&nbsp; 0.75 for the backcross to the rice backcross
<br>Make sure that the variable is numeric rather than a factor or character.
4. Fit the numeric variable you created in (3) to the preference data using a linear model. This is called the additive model, whereby mean preference for rice increases linearly with the proportion of the genome inherited from the rice parent. Evaluate the model fit. (Remember: no <i>P</i> values!)
5. Add another numeric variable to the data set to represent dominance effects that might be present in the hybrids:
<br>&nbsp; 0 for both parental genotypes
<br>&nbsp; 1 for the F1 hybrid genotype
<br>&nbsp; 0.5 for the remaining three hybrid genotypes
<br>Make sure that the variable is numeric rather than a factor or character.
6. Fit a second model to the same preference data that includes both of the numeric variables created in (3) and (5). Leave out any interaction terms. This is the additive plus dominance model. Any dominance effects present will displace the mean value of the hybrids toward one or other of the parents relative to the values predicted by the additive model. Evaluate model fit.
7. Finally, fit a third model that has the original genotype variable as the only explanatory variable. The fit of this model will deviate from the model fitted in (6) if there is interaction (epistasis) between genes inherited from the two parents.
8. Present your results, comparing model fits. Which genetic model best fit the data? Explain and summarize.
9. Explain how the procedure you used above to analyze these data differs from that of conventional null hypothesis significance testing. In your view, would a null hypothesis significance testing approach be a poorer, equivalent, or superior approach to the one used above to decide between the three models? Explain.
10. Include your clean R code in an appendix.
11. Email paper to me as a single pdf file: LASTNAME.FIRSTNAME.ASSIGNMENT3.PDF

## <h2> Assignment 3: Presenting project</h2>
The presentations will take place on the last day of the course, the 4th of April.
Each person will give a presentation of the analyses conducted for assignment 2. The idea is to summarise question - analysis - conclusion within a 3-minute period. There will be a maximum of 2 mites for questions.

General:
- If multiple analyses for different (sub)questions were conducted, pick one.
- Use visual aid.
- You may use as many slides as you want but consider this carefully (more is not always better).
- There will be time for a couple of questions, be prepared.
- Think of ways to get peoples attention and remember your talk.

The rules:
- Maximum of three minutes (strict! Penalty for going over time).
- At least one graph.
- No lengthy, detailed stats output (however beautiful your analysis is....).
